      <p>Shilla hotel has been one of Seoul’s top hotels since its opening in 1979. Shilla is a kingdom name during a period when Korea was split into three different kingdoms centuries ago. The name showcases well the balance of modern service and traditional architecture such as Youngbin Hall. Its prime location and excellent service make it the optimal place for tourists, but Seoul residents often come to enjoy time at the swimming pool, the spa, and most of all the restaurants. Even if you’re not planning to stay at the Shilla Hotel, enjoy a meal at its most famous buffet.
